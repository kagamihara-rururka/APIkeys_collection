# development-workflow Specification

## Purpose

This capability defines how the project uses OpenSpec-aligned development to reduce handoff risk while keeping the backend MVP moving.

## Requirements

### Requirement: OpenSpec Path For Cross-Module Changes

The project SHALL require an OpenSpec-style proposal, task list, acceptance criteria, and risk notes before implementing medium or risky cross-module changes.

#### Scenario: Cross-module backend feature

- GIVEN a change touches crawler, adapter, download plan, import, registry, UI, external integration, or cross-platform setup
- WHEN an agent starts implementation
- THEN the agent SHALL record scope, tasks, acceptance criteria, and known risks in `openspec/changes/` or in the documented transition workflow before editing production code.

#### Scenario: Small safe fix

- GIVEN a change is a narrow bug fix, typo, parser tweak, or focused test update
- WHEN the change does not alter data models, UI information architecture, external integrations, or destructive actions
- THEN the agent MAY implement directly, but SHALL update GTD, handoff, or related documentation if project state changes.

### Requirement: Git-Tracked Specification Source Of Truth

The project SHALL treat Git-tracked OpenSpec files and documentation as the source of truth for development state.

#### Scenario: Spectra GUI is used

- GIVEN Spectra is used to inspect or manage specs
- WHEN a task state, proposal, or requirement changes
- THEN the corresponding files under `openspec/` SHALL be updated and committed, rather than leaving state only inside a GUI session.

### Requirement: OpenSpec Language Policy / OpenSpec 語言規則

The project SHALL allow Traditional Chinese prose inside OpenSpec specs, changes, tasks, design notes, risks, and acceptance criteria.

#### Scenario: Team-facing workflow rule

- GIVEN a rule is meant for the current human team and future agents working in this repository
- WHEN the rule explains intent, workflow boundaries, acceptance criteria, risks, or handoff notes
- THEN the rule SHOULD be written in Traditional Chinese or bilingual Chinese/English so maintainers can read it without extra translation.

#### Scenario: Tool-facing identifiers

- GIVEN a field, file path, capability id, command, CLI flag, product name, or OpenSpec structural marker is consumed by tools or searched by agents
- WHEN writing the OpenSpec artifact
- THEN the identifier SHOULD remain stable ASCII/English, while the explanatory prose MAY be Traditional Chinese.

### Requirement: OpenSpec As Project Habit Memory

The project SHALL use OpenSpec as the durable home for development habits, workflow contracts, acceptance criteria, and cross-agent process rules that are too broad to live only in one agent skill.

#### Scenario: A recurring development habit is discovered

- GIVEN the team identifies a recurring habit such as checkpoint logging, UI hardening boundaries, docs synchronization, or evidence requirements
- WHEN the habit affects future medium or repeated work
- THEN the agent SHOULD record it in an OpenSpec requirement, change, or task before or alongside skill updates.

#### Scenario: Skill and OpenSpec overlap

- GIVEN a skill tells an agent how to act during a session
- WHEN the rule is also a durable project policy
- THEN the skill SHOULD point to the relevant OpenSpec capability or docs route, and OpenSpec SHALL remain the versioned project contract.

### Requirement: Portable Workflow Pattern

The project SHALL keep its development workflow separable enough that the same governance pattern can be reused in other repositories without copying APIkeys_collection-specific domain rules.

#### Scenario: Workflow is copied to another project

- GIVEN another repository wants to reuse this development style
- WHEN preparing the reusable starter set
- THEN the agent SHOULD copy the workflow shape: project GTD, agent handoff, development log, docs index, OpenSpec workspace, project skill, local smoke checks, and checkpoint reporting rules.
- AND the agent SHALL remove or rewrite APIkeys_collection-specific dataset, crawler, provider, Qt, database, renderer, and path rules before using the workflow in the other repository.

#### Scenario: A new project is small

- GIVEN the target repository has not yet developed cross-module risk
- WHEN introducing OpenSpec
- THEN the agent SHOULD start with only a `development-workflow` capability and add domain-specific capabilities only after repeated or risky work justifies them.

### Requirement: Development Mode Triage / 日常與快速交付分流

The project SHALL distinguish routine defensive development from rapid delivery or showcase work before implementation begins.

#### Scenario: Routine development request

- GIVEN the user asks to continue normal development, refactor, harden, test, document, or reduce technical debt
- WHEN the agent starts work
- THEN the agent SHALL use daily development mode: small reviewable slices, durable contracts, tests, docs/GTD/handoff consistency, and low-risk integration.

#### Scenario: Imminent showcase or human-facing delivery

- GIVEN the user mentions a meeting, demo, showcase, team review, GUI operation, PPT/script, deadline such as "中午" or "只剩 X 分鐘/小時", or says the presenter must not edit code
- WHEN the agent starts work
- THEN the agent SHALL use rapid delivery / showcase mode: stable GUI path, truthful backend status, real output or explicitly labeled fixtures, bounded sample controls, fallback disclosure, and presenter-safe artifacts.

#### Scenario: Rapid delivery is complete

- GIVEN a rapid delivery slice has been demonstrated or the delivery window is over
- WHEN returning to normal development
- THEN the agent SHALL convert the useful slice into defensive-programming follow-up tasks, including tests, docs, OpenSpec/GTD updates, and clear boundaries between formal product behavior and showcase-only behavior.

#### Scenario: Progress or output is uncertain

- GIVEN the backend cannot provide a real percentage, total byte count, source availability, or SQL/import guarantee
- WHEN presenting status to a user
- THEN the agent SHALL state the uncertainty plainly instead of fabricating progress, completion, or production readiness.

### Requirement: UI/UX Reference Contract / UIUX 參照契約
The project SHALL convert UI/UX references into explicit interaction contracts before implementing non-trivial UI changes.

#### Scenario: User cites another product as UX reference

- GIVEN the user cites software such as Foxy, Steam, `tem/`, or another app as an example
- WHEN an agent prepares a UI change
- THEN the agent SHALL extract the behavioral intent, user flow, object model, trigger, state transition, backend service, error state, and acceptance criteria.
- AND the agent SHALL NOT copy the reference product name into code, docs, or UI text unless the user explicitly approves that naming.

#### Scenario: UI implementation starts

- GIVEN a UI change alters information architecture, gestures, tabs, list behavior, cards, dynamic forms, or crawler/download workflows
- WHEN the agent starts implementation
- THEN the agent SHOULD first update `docs/UI_UX_DEVELOPMENT_CONTRACT.zh-TW.md`, a relevant OpenSpec change, or both.
- AND the implementation SHALL keep Tk/Qt as skins over backend contracts or view-models rather than embedding crawler/download business logic directly into a large UI file.

### Requirement: MVP-First Process

The workflow SHALL reduce rework and handoff cost without blocking the backend MVP loop.

#### Scenario: Process becomes heavier than the change

- GIVEN a change can be completed and verified in a small local step
- WHEN writing a full proposal would take longer than the implementation and verification
- THEN the agent SHALL keep the process lightweight and document only the durable decision or result.

### Requirement: Tooling Isolation

OpenSpec, Spectra, Qt Creator, and Qt Designer setup SHALL respect the project environment boundaries and SHALL distinguish workstation-specific tooling from cross-platform project facts.

#### Scenario: Python or Qt tooling is needed on macOS

- GIVEN a Python or Qt-related tool is required
- WHEN installing or running that tool
- THEN the agent SHALL prefer `metal_trade_312` and SHALL NOT install Python packages into base or system Python.

#### Scenario: Python or Qt tooling is checked on Windows

- GIVEN the project is running on the Windows workstation
- WHEN an agent needs UI tooling facts
- THEN the agent SHALL run `scripts\check_ui_tooling.cmd` or update its equivalent before assuming Qt Creator, PySide6, or a named Conda environment exists.

#### Scenario: Spectra GUI is installed on macOS

- GIVEN Spectra is installed for this workstation
- WHEN installation location is chosen
- THEN the app SHALL live in user-owned `~/Applications/Spectra.app` unless the user explicitly asks for a system-wide install.

#### Scenario: Spectra GUI is available on Windows

- GIVEN Spectra is installed for this workstation
- WHEN an agent needs to inspect or organize OpenSpec artifacts
- THEN the agent MAY use `C:\Users\lyn59\AppData\Local\Spectra\spectra.exe`, while keeping Git-tracked OpenSpec files as the authority.

### Requirement: Canonical Cloud Workspace And Local Test Clone / 雲端正本與本地測試分流

The project SHALL treat `L:\RRKAL_project` as the canonical cloud workspace for IDE inspection, source edits, commits, and pushes, while using local-disk clones only as proof environments for GUI, showcase, and heavy smoke tests.

Old `K:\APIkeys_collection` is historical/read-only reference for this project unless the user explicitly reassigns it.

#### Scenario: Daily source edit and commit

- GIVEN an agent changes production source, docs, specs, or tests
- WHEN the change is ready to commit
- THEN the change SHALL be present in `L:\RRKAL_project` before commit
- AND the commit/push SHALL originate from `L:\RRKAL_project` unless the user explicitly transfers ownership to another workspace.

#### Scenario: Local clone finds a fix

- GIVEN a local clone under `C:\Users\lyn59\Documents\Codex\RRKAL_local_test\...` is used for GUI, showcase, or smoke testing
- WHEN a bug is fixed or a useful change is discovered in that clone
- THEN the agent SHALL port the change back to `L:\RRKAL_project`
- AND SHALL verify the L workspace before pushing to GitHub.

#### Scenario: GitHub synchronization

- GIVEN L workspace and GitHub differ
- WHEN syncing project state
- THEN the agent SHOULD first make the L workspace the reviewed source of truth, then push from L to GitHub and verify GitHub Actions.
- AND the agent SHALL NOT treat a passing local clone as proof that the L workspace or GitHub has the same change.

### Requirement: Beginner-Friendly Progress Reporting

Agents SHALL describe OpenSpec/process changes in beginner-friendly language.

#### Scenario: Reporting a tooling or workflow checkpoint

- GIVEN the user asks to continue development
- WHEN the agent reports progress
- THEN the report SHALL explain what changed, why it matters, and how much it affects the remaining MVP work in plain Traditional Chinese.
